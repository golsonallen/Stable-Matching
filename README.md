Stable Matching Program
===========================


By Griffin Olson-Allen <griffino@umich.edu>

This program implements the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching. It also contains a 
slightly modified version for less strict pairings, intended for big-little fraternity matching. 

The modified version allows the user to input a specified number of preferences instead of 
forcing them to rank everyone. It also allows for uneven sides, if there are more bigs than littles.
